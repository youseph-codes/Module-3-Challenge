# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
For this project, I was required to create a functional application that an 
employee can use to generate a random password with regards to the criteria
they selected. Although the interface is polished and styled, I was ultimately tasked
with writing up the JavaScript that will power up the webpage. In terms of funtionality, this webpage 
should be able to throw 5 prompts at the user.

- how long does the user want their password to be.
- does the user want uppercase letters included.
- does the user want lowercase letters included.
- does the user want numbers included.
- does the user want special charaters included.

Honestly, this was a very difficult challenge. I dont think I've developed a full understanding of the console
or how it works but I know that I had to tackle this challenge with a more calculated approach.

# Getting Started
## WHEN I click the button to generate a password, THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

This was the overall function of this webpage. to make this happen, I applied the equation below.

## WHEN prompted for password criteria, THEN I select which criteria to include in the password.
## WHEN prompted for the length of the password, THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

I had the criteria show up using a loop equation that holds the user's prompt choices.
